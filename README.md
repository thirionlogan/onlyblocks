# OnlyBlocks

If you are tired of seeing OnlyFan's promotions on your timeline, then this is the bot for you! Visit the website and log in with your Twitter account and enjoy a more wholesome timeline. Here is how it works:

The bot watches a live stream of tweets looking for tweets with OnlyFan's links and blocks the tweet's author. When you visit the bot's site and log in, the bot will use your credentials to block those users on your behalf. Your credentials are not stored; therefore, this is a one-time operation. When the list of blocked tweets grows, you may wish to block more accounts. In that case, log in again! 

I will use the money for hosting and API fees which scale with use. If I do not have the funds to cover the costs, the bot will have to be rate-limited to meet the budget.

I highly appreciate the feedback.

I am open to the possibility of storing credentials for a limited amount of time so that users do not have to log in regularly as long as I can do it securely and there is a want.
